# PvZ2-Code-Port
Some code I rewritten from Plants Vs. Zombies (PvZ) 2.

The purpose of doing this, is from granting the Game the possibility to be Transfered into other Platforms that its not currently available (like Windows, for example).


NOTE: by the moment, this is a Uncompleted Project, meaning that is not the Final result and that it may have some Errors when Implemented.
If you desire, you can help by sending me Pull requests to this Repository, so I'll be able to check and Commit changed to this Work. Thanks for all!
